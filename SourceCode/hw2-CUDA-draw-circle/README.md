# Homework 2, Task 2

Note to reviewer: This task was similar to one of the tasks on the admission test, so I decided to reuse the code. As a result, the code talks about towers and Points of Interest, but in essense, the task is completed.

The program draws circles with CUDA C++ and outputs a PPM file. See Images folder to examine the result.
