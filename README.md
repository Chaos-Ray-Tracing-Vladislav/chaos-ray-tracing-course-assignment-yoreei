# Final Project

I wanted to express my deepest gratitude to all of you. Participating in the Chaos Camp was an incredible experience, and I am extremely grateful for your guidance and support. This was my first time diving into computer graphics, and I can confidently say that I am totally hooked now. The knowledge and inspiration I gained from this camp will stay with me for a long time. Thank you for making this experience so memorable.

The final video shows that I still have some work to do on the KDTree. Also, I opted to implement ambient lighting and skybox instead of global illumination because of time constraints. I will add global illumination to the renderer in the future. For August, the plan is to port the renderer to CUDA.

## Branch State

The main branch is the most up-to-date version of the code. The active PRs are there for the purpose of homework submission, but they are not to be merged into main.
