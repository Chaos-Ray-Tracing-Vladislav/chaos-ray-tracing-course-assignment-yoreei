# Danny (Yordan) Grigorov's Chaos Camp 2024 Project

## My ray tracer has moved to a new home!

I am continuing to add fixes, optimizations and features to my repo, forked from this one:

https://github.com/yoreei/sanctuary-raytracer

This repo here in the Chaos Camp organization will always reflect the ray tracer as it was when Chaos Camp officially ended.

## Final Project

(in this video, you can see a little bug in the KDTree, which is now fixed in the new repo)

I wanted to express my deepest gratitude to all of you. Participating in the Chaos Camp was an incredible experience, and I am extremely grateful for your guidance and support. This was my first time diving into computer graphics, and I can confidently say that I am totally hooked now. The knowledge and inspiration I gained from this camp will stay with me for a long time. Thank you for making this experience so memorable.

The final video shows that I still have some work to do on the KDTree. Also, I opted to implement ambient lighting and skybox instead of global illumination because of time constraints. I will add global illumination to the renderer in the future. For August, the plan is to port the renderer to CUDA.

## Branch State

The main branch is the most up-to-date version of the code. The active PRs are there for the purpose of homework submission, but they are not to be merged into main.
